# @styra/opa-react

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- be7bcb5: `AuthzProviderContext` is a type now (was interface)

  This was done to remove code duplication. No functional changes. But since the
  interface was exported before, some care might have to be taken when updating.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d2b2abc: Add `fromResults` to support unwrapping policy evaluation results

  This allows us to unwrap results returned from OPA to turn them into a boolean.

  Previously, anything different from undefined and false was taken to mean "authorized". Now, we can work with policy evaluation results like

  ```json
  {
    "result": false,
    "details": "..."
  }
  ```

  by providing a `fromResults` function like

  ```ts
  const fromResults = (r?: Result): boolean =>
    ((r as Record<string, any>)["foobar"] as boolean) ?? false;
  ```

  As with input and path, this can (optionally) be set with `<AuthzProvider>` (property `defaultFromResults`), and with `<Authz>` (property `fromResult`), or passed to `useAuthz()`.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6365272: Update README for v0.2.0 change

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- aa75275: Remove function support from <Authz> component

  Allowing a function had unintended consequences for performance, given how
  React works. Now, there is only one way to do it: `fallback` for non-truthy
  results, and `children` for truthy results.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f7eab9c: Remove default export: It seems simpler to only rely on the three exports we have:

  1. `import { AuthzProvider } from "@styra/opa-react";`
  2. `import { Authz } from "@styra/opa-react";`
  3. `import { useAuthz } from "@styra/opa-react";`

  (Besides types and interfaces.)

### Patch Changes
